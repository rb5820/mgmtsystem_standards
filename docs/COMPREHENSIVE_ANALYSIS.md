### **Hierarchical Cost Aggregation**
```
Standard Level
├── Total Implementation Cost: $XXX,XXX
├── Manual Maintenance: $XX,XXX/year (XXXX hours)
└── Combined (Automated): $X,XXX/year (XX hours) → 99%+ savings

Domain Level  
├── Domain Implementation: $XX,XXX
├── Manual Maintenance: $X,XXX/year (XXX hours)
└── Combined Maintenance: $XXX/year (X hours)

Control Level
├── Implementation: $XXX (X minutes setup)
├── Manual Testing: $XXX/year (X minutes × frequency)
└── Automated Testing: $X/year (X seconds × frequency)
```

## 💰 **Cost Tracking System Deep Dive**

### **Time Precision Architecture**
- **Implementation Time**: Minutes-based tracking for accurate resource planning
- **Testing Time**: Separate manual vs. automated timing with frequency multipliers
- **Automatic Conversions**: Minutes ↔ Hours for user convenience
- **Annual Projections**: Frequency-based annual cost calculations

### **Dual Cost Models**
```python
# Manual Only Model
annual_cost = (manual_time × frequency) ÷ 60 × hourly_rate

# Combined Model (Automation Replaces Manual)
if automated_assessment_enabled:
    time_per_test = automated_time ÷ 60  # seconds to minutes
else:
    time_per_test = manual_time
    
annual_cost = (time_per_test × frequency) ÷ 60 × hourly_rate
```

### **ROI Calculation Examples**
```
Quarterly Password Policy Review:
├── Manual: 15 min × 4/year = $100/year
├── Automated: 5 sec × 4/year = $0.55/year  
└── Savings: $99.45/year (99.4% reduction)

Monthly Network Access Review:
├── Manual: 30 min × 12/year = $600/year
├── Automated: 10 sec × 12/year = $3.33/year
└── Savings: $596.67/year (99.4% reduction)
```
